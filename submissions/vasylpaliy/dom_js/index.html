            <p class="main-text"> Once again, seafood is an integral part of its local cuisine,
                and it offers some decent Spanish wine varieties. Of course, it earns it nickname
                Green Galicia from its scenic landscape, boosted by its geographical weather climate.
                Sitting on the north-west coast, temperatures are lower than its counterparts in eastern
                and southern Spain yet, for many people, this is a welcome relief and ideal conditions
                for outdoor explorers.

            <p class="main-text"> Expect lower temperatures in Asturias because this
                delightful region sits on the northern coast. The bonus is wonderful scenic
                landscapes that are a delight to explore, and the selective, Costa Verde that
                in recent years is rising in popularity among discerning holidaymakers and overseas
                property buyers. Naturally, given it shines of Mother Natures power, it attracts all
                outdoor lovers, who mainly flock to the nationally protected park yet dont
                underestimate the sandy beaches of Costa Verde either. </p>

                for the sumptuous local dish of deep-fried squid, alongside other seafood delights.
                Cantabrias other claim to fame is that Santander in the Bay of Biscay that attracts the
                royal family during summer. For us normal members of society, Santander, is a major ferry port,
                hence getting around to other places is easy. While in Cantabria, see the amazing Altamira cave
                painting. An abundance of nature parks makes this a great outdoor region. </p>

            <p class="main-text">This is when understanding Spains autonomous communities can get
                a little confusing. The Basque country, sitting on the border with France, has its own language and is
                fiercely
                independent. Hence, expect a unique culture, and tradition from the mainstream Spanish stereotype.
                its most prominent city is San Sebastian, boasting of an excellent gastronomy scene in Spain.
                Make a mental note to enjoy pincos served in local bars. Bilbao also offers the esteemed
                Guggenheim museum.Galicia lies at the northwest tip of Spain. An Atlantic coastal region.

            <h1 class="main-title">Navarra</h1>
            <p class="main-text"> With this autonomous community, dont think so much about the beaches but more of
                remote
                inland villages screaming of authentic traditions and culture. Controversy surrounds it because of the
                annual
                bull-running tradition, that is part of the Sanfermines festival. Aside from that, being an inland
                region,
                it attracts people who love the great outdoors and rambling over the green hills and mountains. Unlike
                other places
                in Spain, mainstream tourism is not an enormous factor in Navarree, and locals rely on more traditional
                farming methods for sources of income.
