    "Plot": "In the world of elite sports, rock climbing is relatively young. Rock gods and goddesses were pushing the limits of the sport starting in the ’50s and ’60s, but it wasn’t until the late 1970s that climbing started to be documented. Even then, the quality of the documentation was mediocre, at best. Since then, a number of movies and documentaries featuring the radical sport of rock climbing have been released. In this page you may see a synopsis of five of the best climbing films of all time. Each of these documentaries are based on a true story - no Hollywood acting here!",
