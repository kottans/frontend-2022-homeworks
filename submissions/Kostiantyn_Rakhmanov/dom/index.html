                    <p>Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian luxury car manufacturer
                        and a
                        subsidiary of Stellantis. The company was founded on 24 June 1910, in Milan, Italy. "Alfa" is an
                        acronym of its founding name, "Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili." "Anonima" means
                        "anonymous",
                        which was a legal form of company at the time, as it was founded by anonymous investors. In the
                        initial set-up phase, in order to have a building to produce cars, the company bought the
                        Portello
                        factory building of Darracq in Milan, which was closing up and selling all its assets.[3] The
                        brand
                        is known for sport-oriented vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911. Alfa Romeo
                        was
                        owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the company that was responsible for the production of Alfa
                        Romeo cars until its operations were fully merged with those of the PSA Group to form Stellantis
                        on
                        16 January 2021.</p>
