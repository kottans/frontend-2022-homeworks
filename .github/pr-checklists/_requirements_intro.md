Let's do some **self-checks** to fix most common issues and to make some improvements to the code before reviewers put their hands on the code.

Go through the requirements/most common mistakes linked below and fix the code as appropriate.

If you have any questions to requirements/common mistakes **feel free asking** them here or in Students' chat.

When you genuinely believe you are done **put a comment** stating that you have completed self-checks and fixed code accordingly.

Also, be aware, that if you would silently ignore this recommendation, a mentor can think that you are still working on fixes. And your PR will not be reviewed. 😒
